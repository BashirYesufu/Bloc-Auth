## How to Use 

**Step 1:**


You must have Flutter 3.0.0 and Dart Installed to build this project. Check the links above if you haven't done so. You might experience build issues running on a lower flutter version. If you don't have flutter 3.0.0, You can you use fvm to download it and manage your flutter version locally. I have included a link to it.
